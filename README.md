# To-Do List (terminal based)

<!-- Create a simple to-do list application using C programming language.

The application should have the following features:
- The user can add tasks to the list
- The user can view the task on the list
- The user can mark tasks as completed or remove them from the list
- The application should be terminal-based, just like your previous projects

This project is a good git for your portfolio because is a practical application that many people would find usedul. Additionally, it's not too advanced, so it should be achievable even if you're not a seasoned programmer. (the text is from chatGPT, where I got the idea from) -->
